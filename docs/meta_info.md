# Meta Information

## About

As the name implies, this is currently a **proposition**, proposed to the Minecraft datapack community for discussion and contribution. It is the intention to gather community feedback and approval before finalizing any aspect of this proposition. Areas marked by `TENTATIVE: <reason>` are in particular need of discussion/consensus.


Regardless, the described specification is **feature-complete** and should be able to be implemented fully.

For those that desire to give the specification a try: 

* See *[Known Issues](./issues.md)*.
* If implementing on an existing datapack, please make a backup beforehand.
* [SlimeCore Dev. Tools](https://github.com/sixslimemc/scdev) is an external datapack that provides minimal, useful tools for developing alongside [SlimeCore](./slimecore/index.md). It is in no way required (and can be re-implemented quite easily), but may reduce friction when trying to get started quickly.
* Thank you.
